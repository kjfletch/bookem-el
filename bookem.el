;;; bookem.el --- Bookmark system organising buffers into groups
;;
;; Author: Kevin J. Fletcher <kevinjohn.fletcher@googlemail.com>
;; Maintainer: Kevin J. Fletcher <kevinjohn.fletcher@googlemail.com>
;; Keywords: bookem, bookmarks
;; Homepage: http://github.com/kjfletch/bookem-el
;; Version: <WIP>
;; 
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides a bookmark system for emacs called bookem. This
;; allows you to create bookmarks for files and other special buffers
;; and organise them into groups.
;;
;; Bookmark types:
;;  file      - simple bookmark for a line in a file.
;;              also works on dired buffers.
;;  c-defun   - bookmark a function in a c file.
;;  info      - TODO Bookmark a location in an info document.
;;  woman     - TODO Bookmark a position in a man page.
